			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
					<p>I am a Sales Engineer at a local SaaS software company, HubSpot. We offer a complete marketing platform, built with non-technical marketers in mind but powerful enough for highly technical, sophisticated users as well. My job is to assist with the technical portion of the sale, be a product expert and offer technical solutions to business problems.<br><br>I grew up in Brookline, and received my undergraduate degree from Tulane University in Communications.</p>
				<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
					<p>Since I am now employed in a technical position, and did not study programming in college, I am here to beef up my server side programming skills. Mastering these skills will help me advance in my career.</p>
				<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
					<p>I have studied light JavaScript (and by extension, jQuery) independently for the last few years, and completed part of Harvard's CS50 programming course last fall, but had to withdraw due to personal circumstances. Due to the nature of my day to day job, I conceptually have a firm grasp of most major programming constructs and popular methods of software integration such as REST APIs, JSON output, and webhooks. I'm looking forward to developing a practical understanding of these constructs throughout the semester.</p> 
				<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
					<p>I use a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro PC for my coursework, but use both operating systems on a regular basis (Macbook Air for work).</p>
				<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
					<p>I live in Arlington with my boyfriend and have one younger sister, who lives in Somerville. We love playing Mario Kart and brewing craft beer in our spare time!</p>
